# FREEZY

Firefox extension to prevent events to be captured.

**Obs:** Probably decrease site's usability.

Prevent these [mouse events](https://github.com/paulojean/freezy/blob/master/content_scripts/freezy.js#L1-L10) to be captured by default (this can be changed from the options page).

# TODO
- [x] Allow/Disable based on config
- [x] Allow user to add/remove Events to be blocked
